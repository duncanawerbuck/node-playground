Just me mucking around with node.js

Ensure you have a file called "info.txt" in the same folder as readFromFile.js.

Running readFromFile.js should determine the longest word in each line of the text file.

There's no real error checking, or performance tuning. This was more an experiment in getting my head around the functional/async style node uses.
